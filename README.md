For a first real html/css project I will make the Google homepage. Not in working order obviously but I will give me a grasp of how things align and move on a page.

Things I have learned is positioning, floating, structure and coloring. As well as general styling of buttons and forms etc.

Still lack a complete grasp of html/css, somethings were just luck. But in the end it works and its not a complete mess!
